The main focus of this thesis is to examine an algorithm for finding Hamiltonian cycles on random digraphs \cite{frieze:dham}, and using that method to experimentally check it's validity on other models of random graphs. 

In \autoref{ch:dham} we look at the DHAM algorithm closely, and verifying it's performance and accuracy claims experimentally. We further go on to check whether modifying some parameters in the algorithm itself could potentially improve it's runtime.

In \autoref{ch:exp} we consider some other models of graphs such as random tournaments, and random regular digraphs, and look at the performance of DHAM on these graphs.
